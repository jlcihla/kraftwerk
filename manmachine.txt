The Man-Machine stands as one of the pinnacles of 70's rock music
Contains song THE ROBOTS where lyrics reference the revolutionary technique of robotics, and how humans can use them as they wish
When the song is performed live, the band is traditionally replaced by robots that resemble themselves
I also like the song THE MODEL from this album
